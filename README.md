# Raycaster
A simple raycaster made in Vanilla JavaScript.

## How It Works
A player is put into a 2d map. The play sends out rays at a certain 
field of view. These rays then shoot forward until they hit a surface 
or until they hit a certain distance. Their distance is saved. A loop 
loops though all these distances and draws a line in the screen, a long 
line if the distance is small, and if the distance is big, it draws a
smaller line.
